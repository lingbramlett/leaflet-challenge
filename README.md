Module 15 Challenge - Leaflet
In this challenge, JavaScript and Leaflet were used to create an interactive map visualizing earthquake data from the United States Geological Survey (USGS).

The dataset includes all recorded earthquakes worldwide with a magnitude of 1.0 or higher over the past seven days. This real-time data was retrieved from the USGS GeoJSON Feed.

Using Leaflet, the map plots each earthquake based on its latitude and longitude, displaying relevant details through interactive popups.

The earthquake map is displayed in the index.html file.
